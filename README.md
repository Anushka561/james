**James** has common classes and interfaces for truly object-oriented projects.

James is fully interface-based. It means that every class implements at least one interface.

It (will) contains the basics classes for another libraries. Sometimes James may be just a wrapper to the RTL.

The code have some principles:

1. all classes are sealed
2. all methods return an interface instance or primitive type
3. all public methods are implementations of interface methods
4. memory is released automatically
5. there are not setters in any class
