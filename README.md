James is a collection of object-oriented Pascal primitives.

**ATTENTION:** We're still in a very early alpha version, the API may and will change frequently. Please, use it at your own risk, until we release version 1.0.

# Overview

This API is being written in [Free Pascal](https://freepascal.org/) and [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/). However, it is also compatible with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi).

# Concepts

We don't want to write procedural code anymore.
The goal is to replace common procedural code in our projects, which has so many conditionals and "controllers", to a declarative and object-oriented code.
We want to write elegant, clean, and maintainable code using OOP.

This project has some design principles:

* Fully interface-based
* Memory is released automatically
* All public methods are implementations of interface methods
* All public methods return an interface instance or primitive type
* No usage of nil/NULL in arguments or returns
* No algorithms in constructors
* No getters and setters
* No procedures or functions, only interfaces and objects

# Installing

- Clone the repository in some directory in your computer.
- For each project you just need to setup the paths, which depends on your platform are you using.
- See [Dependencies](#dependencies) below too
  
## On Lazarus

In your project, you must include these paths:

- Other unit files (-Fu)
  - include `/src` and `/src/fpc`
- Include files (-Fi)
  - include only `/src`

## On Delphi

In your project, you must include these paths:

- Search Path
  - include `/src` and `/src/delphi`
  
# Dependencies

- [mORMot](https://github.com/synopse/mORMot) â€” client-server ORM SOA MVC framework for Delphi 6 up to latest Delphi and FPC
  You need to [install](https://synopse.info/files/html/Synopse%20mORMot%20Framework%20SAD%201.18.html#TITL_113) it first. Basically, it means clone the repository in some directory in your computer. That's all.

As mORMot do not have packages, it works only by paths. 

To run James TestAll project easily you should save mORMot at the same level of James:

    lib
      james
      mormot
      
Alternatively, you can change paths of TestAll pointing to your copy of mORMot in another place.
